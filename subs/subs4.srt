1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,726
To go right up the border and stay in my own time zone. That's a

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:07,310
whole lot easier. And so what I will also

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,466
make fun of as I'm working with a beginner is drawing

4
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:15,086
this line. Now, Belarus is just on

5
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:19,578
the other side also, but they decided not to change their clocks.

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:23,086
And so sometimes it is 1 hour here

7
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,630
difference, but sometimes here is 2 hours

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,150
difference because they stay on the same clock.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,050
So not only am I walking from Poland to Belarus,

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,714
but I am now gaining 2 hours of life back

11
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:43,194
or losing 2 hours of life by just simply moving 1.

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,442
So that means that they invented two

13
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:50,366
different time zones in the same area. And so when

14
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:51,840
I sing up in this area,

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,880
I can be in that mode. Or La.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,678
Or La. I have all these options

17
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:05,474
up in here. But my question to a beginner is

18
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:07,380
what do the animals care?

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,660
There are animals that cross these borders all the time.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,726
Will a fox reset his watch when he

21
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:20,902
crosses over? Does a bird flying this way or that way change

22
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,434
his meal plan? Will the snakes

23
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:28,490
care that they're in Belarus versus Poland? The idea

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,942
here is simple, that there is natural forces.

25
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:35,930
Time moves. The earth is revolving. All that's true.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,546
But humans have set down borders, a lot

27
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:43,690
of borders, and we socially agree to those borders.

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,722
And so, yes, there are different resonant zones

29
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,558
that happen inside us as we sing,

30
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:54,418
but we create the boundary between them by

31
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:58,082
creating a group of pitches because that's what brains like.

32
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:02,178
They want things to be boundaried. And so this EF here

33
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:05,986
doesn't mention one thing every time when I

34
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:09,446
was in college and they would tell me that that's where the first passagio is

35
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:12,870
for male, I would say, at what volume?

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,982
Because it matters. And so the idea of

37
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:20,374
thinking of all this multicolor or multidimensional

38
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:23,580
sound is that we have lots of options.

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,226
And so I tend to ask one or

40
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,734
two questions are you comfortable? Are you in

41
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:34,560
control? So when somebody is singing La La,

42
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't even have to ask if they're comfortable. I know they're not.

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,750
And I don't usually ask if they're in control,

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,578
but it depends what style of music they like, because sometimes a

45
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:50,046
very raspy or distorted sound is their intention,

46
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,746
is their desired outcome. So I ask them, is that a

47
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,510
sound you mean to make? And if they say yes,

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,182
yeah, that's the sound they mean to make. Then I ask them,

49
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:04,230
are you comfortable making that sound? And I then

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,266
move on from there. So I let them decide,

51
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,222
and I think that's very important. But what I tell about this

52
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,614
resonant package wait a minute. Let me get my hand right. This resonant package,

53
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:18,170
all right, here is that for animals, this is

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,774
shared space. So I

55
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,910
want people to think of resonance as wildlife.

56
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,974
Resonance will roam where it wants to.

57
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:33,314
So beginners will often feel a little insecure if

58
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:38,306
they feel as

59
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:41,614
they sing higher or lower, they may sense the resonance

60
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,946
in their body and of course then they may sense it wanting to go

61
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:48,214
up into their head. And if they block that because they

62
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:51,894
feel that's out of control. I will remind them that

63
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,266
the wildlife is going across these borders

64
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:58,666
here very freely. It roams where it

65
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:02,074
wants to, where the food is. And so we

66
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:06,220
want to think of resonance as a shared space.

67
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,294
There are no boundaries in the body. And this shared

68
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:14,026
space to me is the whole message of mixed voice,

69
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:17,854
is to keep blending and keep combining and to

70
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:21,854
allow all of this area here to be a shared space and that

71
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:25,570
it is percentages. We may be dominant in one

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,106
area and

73
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:32,590
then dominant in another area, but there is no border,

74
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,582
there is no line. And any which

75
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:40,310
way you can get a beginner singer to change

76
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,310
their perception that there is rigid boundaries,

77
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,514
that's a good thing. And so I have many analogies,

78
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,626
but I decided on this one because I wanted to try out my

79
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,874
little map of Poland. And so the idea of

80
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:58,122
whatever a person's advocation is,

81
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:01,822
what their job is, I will try to discover what information

82
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:05,470
they already have. You could also use temperature.

83
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,602
There is obviously a big swing in temperature. From zero Celsius

84
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,678
to 100 Celsius is a wide swing.

85
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:17,534
But where's warm begin? Where does cold

86
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:21,860
begin? So everybody has a personal

87
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,450
thing that they will say they're cold or warm,

88
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,320
but it won't be the same degree for everyone.

89
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,526
And so that idea of a spectrum is a

90
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:37,026
very important one. For a beginner to begin to plant

91
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:40,234
the seed, they will need coordination, they will

92
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,850
need skill to be able to navigate around their bias.

93
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,542
And that's all it is, is a prejudice, a bias,

94
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:51,482
and it's based on a fear of embarrassment. And so

95
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,686
they do not want to venture from land to

96
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,190
land. It's much easier for them to stay in one place

97
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,546
or another. And so I encourage them to cross

98
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:05,794
the borders, to think of this like wildlife as a free space,

99
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:09,374
as it's very important for them to be able to navigate.

100
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,882
So I say share the space. And I'm always saying

101
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:16,146
this because I want them to share the space in order to

102
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,240
free their voice. So it's easy to travel.

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,426
Often a beginner will come back to me and say it can't

104
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:27,094
be that easy. Yeah, you say that because you can sing through that

105
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,614
area is what they'll tell me. And I'll say, no, you could

106
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:34,790
do it if you ask for the sound and explore sounds as

107
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,294
play, because that's exactly what you did when you asked

108
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:42,080
for a sound when you were this years old.

109
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,854
So if it seems like something very difficult to them,

110
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:50,138
it's because they're not remembering that when they really championed

111
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:53,940
this thing called voice use. They were one year old,

112
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,914
and if they can do it when they were one, how complex the

113
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,578
speech is of any language. I often

114
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:06,498
ask them to Google, is it singing

115
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:09,350
in the MRI? I think that's the name of the video.

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,760
And there's also X ray videos of people speaking.

117
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,322
And they're marvelous to show, to beginners.

118
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,962
Because the complexity of what's going on

119
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,750
inside us while we sing is a miracle.

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,322
But it's also innate meaning. The person

121
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:31,610
that's being X rayed at that moment is not thinking about the tongue

122
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,406
and the palate and the air and the tube above it.

123
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:39,966
They're simply thinking about a communication. So they are asking for

124
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,214
that communication to come through. That's what we did

125
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:46,910
when we were little tots that's how we learned to use our voice.

126
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,482
And we have our parents to thank for that, what they gave us.

127
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:53,762
But it is that simple premise that I like to begin

128
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:58,386
with, with a person that identifies as a beginner.

129
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,166
And so now if there's any questions, I'll be happy to

130
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,400
entertain them.

131
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,482
I'm watching the chat and there are no questions

132
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:19,340
so far. Oh, yes, there are.

133
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,800
There's people that are not asking them.

134
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,622
Show of hands, how many people think of pitch and

135
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:32,110
tone and volume and time as the same

136
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,740
thing all combined as one.

137
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,606
And so the idea of separating it and this is

138
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:46,666
how we're taught it's not our fault. We are taught pitch is frequency,

139
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:50,206
volume is amplitude, right? And we see these pictures

140
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:53,746
of them separated and we hear about these things and

141
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:57,474
we look at even Voice vista or whatever that program is called,

142
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,358
and we see how things are separated, like so.

143
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:04,200
But it's often not discussed as a single

144
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,242
sound. And that's exactly what singers

145
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:12,470
are looking to cultivate, is the package, the entirety

146
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,026
of it, because the empathy of

147
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:19,722
a listener is at stake. What we're really looking

148
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,610
to do is to create a message. And the way we create

149
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,694
those messages is with sounds. And so the sound

150
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:31,294
if I were to say this, I've never

151
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:34,878
been so happy in my life. This is the best day.

152
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,600
I can't believe how good today is going.

153
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,114
That doesn't sound very believable. Oh, my God, I am so

154
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:45,426
depressed. I have never been so incredibly depressed in my

155
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:49,118
life. I think I'm just going to kill myself right now.

156
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:53,506
That's not appropriate. And so if we are singing

157
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:57,410
and now hijacked by the strict

158
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,554
muscle rules we have so

159
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,122
if I sing I love you that

160
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:11,066
way, it may not convey what I

161
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:14,650
love you conveys.

162
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,146
There's a little mystery if I delay and there's

163
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:22,766
that element of time, very important element of time.

164
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:26,410
Or if I love you or

165
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,660
I love you or

166
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,914
I love you or I love

167
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:38,020
you that doesn't sound very good.

168
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,606
Or I love you that's a little

169
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,080
creepy. Or I love you.

170
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,990
I love you. So there's many ways,

171
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,820
a million ways to sing the same three words.

172
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,402
Some will hit the heart, some will hit the head,

173
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:01,366
some will go right over because they're not appropriate.

174
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,922
So we as singers and teachers of singers

175
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:09,040
need to be addressing the whole of the sound

176
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,086
because it is the whole of the sound that is being assessed by the

177
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:16,574
listener. And so if somebody is

178
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:21,150
struggling with pitch, often I will focus on their timbre

179
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,122
or their volume and I will tell them that we're working

180
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:28,242
on those and they will say, no, I'm always

181
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:32,578
sharp or I'm always flat. And they need to work on that specifically.

182
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:36,642
And I will inform them, you're always flat or sharp

183
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:40,434
because your volume or your timbre or your timing

184
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,674
is inappropriate because it's out of

185
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:47,930
control. Again, we go to those two factors, comfort and

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,482
control. And so I will inform them after

187
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:55,218
a while, they start to get the image that one affects

188
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:58,686
the other. And so the idea of putting them

189
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,302
all together to make it holistic in terms of sound,

190
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:06,186
I think is a more accurate approach, is more beneficial

191
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:08,820
to the end result people are looking for.

192
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,874
And so is there any questions now about separating these into

193
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,170
four variables?

194
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,280
Maybe I will ask the question, as we know,

195
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,742
hundreds of exercises for a

196
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,054
problem. So there is a vowel

197
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:38,422
exercise which will help you with timbre.

198
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:42,774
There is an exercise to CTTA muscles coordination

199
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:47,246
that works on pitch. And I

200
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,702
heard your exercises before and I just loved how

201
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:54,990
they join all those different ideas.

202
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,874
How do you construct the exercise? How do you think about it

203
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:03,746
to do more than one thing at once? Because all

204
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:07,780
the exercises you already mentioned are also doing everything at once.

205
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,702
It is simply a label that you're putting on it.

206
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,414
And so in other words, when you're saying

207
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:18,710
to a student, okay, now we're going to work the CT muscle.

208
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,506
And we'll do there

209
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:28,406
is a specific volume I am singing at, there's a specific timbre

210
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:32,790
I am creating. And it is under the illusion

211
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,522
that I'm just isolating one muscle, which is also impossible.

212
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,378
And so anytime we're trying to work just one muscle

213
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,206
within the vocal mechanism, other muscles are always

214
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:47,994
being introduced, of course. And so the CT

215
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,990
never acts alone without the thyroid arynoid.

216
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,214
Those arynoids in the back are also very active.

217
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:59,134
And so it's a focus that we're

218
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:03,490
moving. And so the idea here is that I'm just always explaining

219
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,760
to people I'm working with that it's a sound,

220
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,706
it's not just a pitch. And so the idea of keeping

221
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:14,922
that made me extend, how can I keep

222
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:18,262
that presence? How can I keep that premise

223
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:21,894
alive? And so as I'm inventing exercises,

224
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:25,898
because I have somebody that's stubborn in front of me, let's say I will

225
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:29,882
keep asking myself I have to analyze physically

226
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:33,406
what they're doing. Of course, that's what we do as teachers. And then I have

227
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:37,466
to say to myself, okay, but you can't feel the CT

228
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:41,442
muscle, you can't feel the thyroid or retinoid muscle. So if I start mentioning that

229
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:45,886
to the student, they're going to go looking for something that feels

230
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:49,394
different than what they've been doing before. So I found that

231
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:53,662
tends to promote extraneous tensions, because now if

232
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,378
no, I want you to use your CT muscle, we're going to pull the folds

233
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:00,934
a little more to get that pitch in tune. They're going to add

234
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,742
in muscles they can feel as a feedback loop,

235
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,314
and it will give them a difference. I was doing

236
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:12,038
this. Now I feel different and I hit the pitch.

237
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:16,234
That's a problem. When we get success that included

238
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,962
extra muscle because now the brain is going to say, AHA.

239
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,040
So I want to feel these muscles lock in.

240
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,526
That's how I learned because I was singing for

241
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:32,126
a living first and then learned

242
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:35,650
about the voice second. And so when you sing for a living,

243
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,946
you have to make it through the song. You have to make it through the

244
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,418
night, you have to make it through the week, or else you don't eat,

245
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:45,774
you don't pay your rent, and you got to call your parents,

246
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:49,874
and they don't like that. And so the point here is that I

247
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:50,750
used pressure.
