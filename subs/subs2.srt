1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,214
Her and into a child. And then of course

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:06,682
through puberty and adulthood. But the connection

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:11,182
that we make and how we all are using our voices I

4
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:15,274
obviously was developing English along with my voice

5
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:19,102
use. You people mostly were developing Polish or

6
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:22,446
whatever language was spoken in the home. And so all

7
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:27,490
of that sort of begs to be of recognized

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,026
is the best word. Because anyone that feels

9
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:34,582
like a beginner or identifies as a beginner is

10
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,782
not giving themselves credit for all the years

11
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:41,626
that they've already been using their voice. And that matters when

12
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:45,766
it comes to singing and revealing oneself through a song.

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,226
And so when we think about beginners, some of you

14
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,930
here might also be a beginner teacher.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,602
And that again is a funny term to be a beginner teacher

16
00:00:56,746 --> 00:01:00,446
because as soon as we are able to speak and if you

17
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:04,290
have siblings or friends, you've been teaching

18
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,302
all throughout your life. And it's just a formal

19
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:11,634
label that we put that I use. And many

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,902
people use that. They teach math or they teach English

21
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:19,234
or they teach science. But there's

22
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,626
many times that we're teaching throughout our life that we don't

23
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:26,774
think of it as teaching. And so if you think back to voice use,

24
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:29,530
who was your first teacher?

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,422
Of course, everybody's. Parents or caretakers.

26
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:38,074
And did they have a degree? Did they have

27
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,440
any education in raising another human?

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,000
Was there lessons that they took?

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,334
No is the answer. They just nine

30
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:51,962
months previous had a really good night and then boom,

31
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:55,774
here we are. And so the idea of becoming

32
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:59,778
the most important person in the world to somebody should

33
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:02,946
have some formal training to go with it, but it

34
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,160
does not. And so when you think about taking on

35
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,042
giving advice to another person as a teacher,

36
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:14,646
you want to give advice to a singer that wants to

37
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,294
improve. You may feel a lot of pressure. You may feel

38
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:22,214
like, I don't know if I know enough, I don't know if I'm

39
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:25,962
educated enough in order to help somebody sing better.

40
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,594
But the truth is you are just by the act

41
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,670
of caring, by the act of wanting to help.

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,990
And so what do you think is the most important thing

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,066
that I know that beginner singers don't

44
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,074
know? Think about

45
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:48,370
that. What is the most important thing that I know

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,140
that beginner singers do not know?

47
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,680
The answer is I know they can sing.

48
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,414
They don't know they can sing. They don't trust themselves,

49
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:05,286
they're doubting. And so the whole reason that

50
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:08,614
they would come to me or you or anyone teaching

51
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:12,170
is that they need evidence, they need convincing.

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,914
And so your ability to help guide them

53
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:20,150
through all of their doubt is what lessons basically

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,858
take. So when you think back to parents, what did parents

55
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,574
teach their kids? They taught them that they knew

56
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:31,854
they could speak and so they just over a

57
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,406
time oh do boo boo. This is Mama

58
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:38,834
this is dada. We make sounds,

59
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,322
we play with our voice and this is the best way to

60
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:45,730
introduce controlled voice use to

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,334
anyone no matter their age. And how

62
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:52,966
did your parents teach you to walk? Did they teach you

63
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:56,086
about the muscles in your legs? Did they teach you

64
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,810
about balance and how to move your arms?

65
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,098
No, they simply knew you could walk

66
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:07,110
even before you could walk. And so a baby

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,714
is simply encouraged to first crawl and

68
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:14,282
then to stand up. And as the baby stands,

69
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:18,094
it gets encouragement and then people put their arms out

70
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,834
and the baby tries to go. And that's exactly as a baby

71
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,554
is trying to formulate words and starts figuring out that

72
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:29,646
these words have meaning and that it creates actions

73
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:33,442
and responses. So there's a whole lot going on

74
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:37,494
in the mind as we are learning to walk and talk and

75
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:40,950
navigate our families. And that's really important

76
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,486
to remember many years later. Now when you

77
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,806
have another person in front of you desiring

78
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:51,994
to do better, your belief that

79
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,690
they can is number one is so

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,542
important. And that's really important to remember because

81
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,954
singing is innate, just like walking is innate.

82
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,800
So we're not really teaching people how to sing.

83
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,390
Even though we describe the many muscles that are involved.

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,714
Usually we have a focus of about 20

85
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:21,486
or maybe 30 muscles tops that we start explaining

86
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:25,006
to people. These are what the vocal folds are doing and the thyroid,

87
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,806
arynoid muscle and many different muscles that we're familiar with. But there

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,754
are up to 100 muscles that are responsible

89
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,566
for me speaking right now and I'm not thinking of any of

90
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,674
them and neither do you when you speak.

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,526
And so it's not really how to sing that we're focused

92
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,980
on, it's what to sing.

93
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,942
Just like when our parents taught us

94
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:53,390
how to walk, they really taught us where

95
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,246
to walk. Walk over here, don't walk in the

96
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,510
street don't walk down those stairs without me.

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,562
So the idea of navigating the world was

98
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,466
taught by boundaries. And we want to navigate our

99
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:12,366
voice the same way. Because once we establish a song,

100
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,874
there's going to be boundaries, there will be a melody, there will be

101
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:19,880
lyrics. So now all of a sudden, what was free is now

102
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,214
in restricted form. And so it's really important to just

103
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:27,778
remember that what to sing is what we're giving

104
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:32,122
choices to people. And I like to take it a step further and

105
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:36,330
explain what to think. Because the perspective that someone

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,006
has, like they identify themselves as

107
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,854
a beginner, that perspective is very important that

108
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:47,086
it change so that their body is free.

109
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:49,520
Because what's happening up in here,

110
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,634
what's happening up in here is now going to rain down through

111
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:58,866
all those connections, all those nerves. And what

112
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:03,038
we're working ourselves through is not ignorance.

113
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,294
These people are not dumb to voice use,

114
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,550
they're simply inhibited.

115
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,758
And so as that perspective is trying to rain down.

116
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:16,546
If somebody is afraid to walk or afraid

117
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:20,442
of where they're walking, their motions will be very

118
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:24,490
restricted, very tense. If you're walking

119
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,770
next to a very high cliff or if you're walking in a bad neighborhood,

120
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,014
your movements will reflect that there

121
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:37,294
is danger in your mind. Just like

122
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,574
when people speak to somebody that they're friends with,

123
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:44,274
with somebody that they're intimate with, their voice use is

124
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:47,650
very comfortable. But in a situation like this,

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,774
when I know there's people listening, I can feel that I'm aware

126
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,574
of how I'm speaking. And obviously, when we sing, we are

127
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:59,474
aware that people are listening and assessing.

128
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,062
So it's a different circumstance. So we have to work through

129
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,234
that inhibition. And as teachers, we help others

130
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,130
work through that inhibition.

131
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,020
And so let me see where I am here.

132
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,274
So the learning to sing is really learning to get through that

133
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:23,614
inhibition. And the way to do that is to take the instrument that

134
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:27,102
everybody I get asked a lot. I don't know about you, but I get asked

135
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,160
a lot if I believe everyone can sing.

136
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,700
And yes, I believe everyone can sing,

137
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,382
just not well, because everybody has these parts,

138
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:42,386
because the parts of the voice and everyone who

139
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:45,574
can speak can sing. But in order

140
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:49,094
to sing with intentional sounds, in order to sing with

141
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:52,546
grace, we need to build a better instrument.

142
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,942
So really, learning to sing well means

143
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:59,126
learning to become a better instrument.

144
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,534
An instrument that's compliant agrees

145
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,754
with the laws of physics and an instrument that

146
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,290
is connected to your thoughts, to your whims.

147
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,258
Imagine if you went to a guitar lesson

148
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:17,082
and the first lesson you walked in without a guitar

149
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:21,054
and the teacher handed you a piece of wood and said,

150
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:24,442
here's a picture of a guitar, here's the material

151
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:28,002
that it's made out of. I want you to go home and make this

152
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,426
instrument and then when you come back, I will teach you how

153
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:34,500
to play it. And if that was the case,

154
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,142
the instrument we would build would probably be something like

155
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:39,800
this.

156
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,686
It would not be in agreement with the laws of sound.

157
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:50,230
It takes a long time to become a craftsman

158
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,898
at building an instrument. It has to agree

159
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:58,106
with the laws of physics. And so when we learn to sing,

160
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:02,126
ideally, all we're doing is learning to be in agreement with

161
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:06,442
the physics of sound and with the revealing

162
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:10,474
of our whims. And so that combination means we've

163
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,970
always been able to sing, but now we need to organize that

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,330
so that we are becoming a better instrument.

165
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,266
And so people ask me all the time what are the

166
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,850
most important things to be a better instrument?

167
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,590
And especially if I'm working with somebody that's a professional.

168
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,370
The first absolute number one most important thing for the condition

169
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,590
of your voice is sleep.

170
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,986
That has the most influence on what the

171
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,570
instrument's ability to do is because there's a

172
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,422
hierarchy when sleep is deprived

173
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:52,538
our focus wanes. And when sleep is deprived,

174
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:56,206
our digestion changes. It's what's called a

175
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:59,834
circadian rhythm. The body has an internal clock.

176
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:03,774
And if we don't get proper sleep, good sleep,

177
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,630
deep sleep, if we don't get deep sleep,

178
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,758
then all of the systems are thrown off the timing.

179
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:15,714
And so you may not be able to digest food.

180
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:19,234
You may have trouble with mucous membranes being dry.

181
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:23,094
And like I said, the focus is gone. And so

182
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:27,014
sleep is number one most important. But if I ask

183
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,394
a beginner to get more sleep, will that

184
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:34,442
improve their skills? Probably not. And so

185
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:37,914
it goes beyond that. And the next number two

186
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:41,290
most important influence on the voice,

187
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,442
it is hydration. And hydration

188
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:50,560
is number two, even though we all talk about it like it's number one.

189
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,558
Because if you are lacking sleep, if you don't

190
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:58,482
have proper sleep, then no amount of water you drink will

191
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:02,690
reach those cells because it is in deep sleep.

192
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,222
Deep sleep, right there. It is in deep sleep where

193
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:10,530
the cells are replenished. First they're cleansed

194
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,374
and then they're hydrated. And so deep sleep is the

195
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,442
deep clean that our voice needs. And of course,

196
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:21,242
hydration is the tool to flush out toxins, but also

197
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:25,254
to replenish. And so hydration is more than just drinking

198
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:29,318
water. It also means your trace mineral levels

199
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,746
and sodium levels in your body because that's

200
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:36,106
how the body retains that hydration retains

201
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,726
that water. And so diet is tied to

202
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:43,490
that as well as sleep. But that's number two. And so

203
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,634
the number three most important

204
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:51,650
influence on our voice would be vocalizing.

205
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,978
Vocalizing is the act of exercising the voice

206
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:00,518
and challenging it in many different ways

207
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,990
just exactly like we exercise our bodies.

208
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,170
And as we do that, we want to put focus

209
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,638
on where we find weaknesses and lacks

210
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:15,066
of coordination. It's kind of the opposite of

211
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:19,178
what we do when we sing songs. And so although everybody

212
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,494
enjoys singing songs and can't wait to get there during

213
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,982
a lesson, though vocalizing the warming up

214
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:30,522
the exercises present a much better way to enhance

215
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:33,854
the instrument to connect it. Because the biggest

216
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:37,982
hurdle we face when you feel like a beginner

217
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:42,014
or when you're working with somebody that identifies as a beginner

218
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:45,974
is a fear of singing. And that, of course,

219
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,622
doesn't really mean they fear singing. What they really fear is

220
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:52,902
the embarrassment. The embarrassment that comes

221
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,040
along with socially unacceptable sounds.

222
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,134
When they sing, they feel very vulnerable.

223
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:04,042
They feel exposed. And so

224
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:07,786
that feeling will reflect in their voice and they

225
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:11,534
will lose control, of course. And so really what we need to

226
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:15,726
encourage when we're working with somebody without much experience is

227
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:19,626
they need to sort of like boost their courage.

228
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,234
So I like to try and keep it very simple. When I'm working with

229
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:26,318
somebody that feels they are a beginner,

230
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:29,922
it can be very overwhelming to them. And I

231
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:33,294
applaud them for seeking help because it's

232
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:37,294
always better to work with somebody an outside opinion

233
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:40,886
in order to really assess where you may be getting in your way.

234
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:44,406
And it takes courage just to reach out to somebody. So we

235
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:47,826
have to remember as teachers that this is a big leap

236
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:51,546
of faith when somebody comes to us and says that they're a

237
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:55,366
beginner singer and want help because they're assuming there's

238
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:59,242
a lot of rules to singing and they want to make sure they get those

239
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:03,022
right. And so the first thing to encourage them to do is

240
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:06,126
to applaud themselves for having the courage to step it

241
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:09,182
up. So my word to them is we look for two

242
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:12,790
things. I just want beginners to be comfortable

243
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,334
and in control, and there's

244
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,714
two things to each. So when we talk

245
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,102
about comfort, there is both physical

246
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:27,090
comfort that's obvious, but there's also emotional

247
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,310
comfort. And those two are very different,

248
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,734
yet affect each other. So when working with

249
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:38,082
somebody without much experience, I like to focus on emotional

250
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:43,654
comfort. I want to make sure that what they do is

251
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,094
being encouraged, that there are no bad sounds.

252
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:51,230
I want them to be playful, I want to be brave

253
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:51,820
and.
