1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,760
A. Make that sound

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,680
good.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,920
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,960
You? Yeah.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,120
Good. Yeah.

6
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,560
Good.

7
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,120
Yeah.

8
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,760
Beginning good.

9
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,270
So, Axel, would you say your low note is

10
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,866
lower volume than the high note or louder

11
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:25,590
volume?

12
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,424
Can you ask him if he thinks the low note is louder

13
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,100
or softer than where he begins?

14
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,876
Repeat please. Because I was on the chat with

15
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:55,304
our participants, so I'm looking to see

16
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:59,236
if he thinks that the low note is louder

17
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,320
or softer than where he's beginning.

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,564
The softer low note is softer. I agree.

19
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:19,368
And so can he please pay attention?

20
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:20,380
OOH.

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,940
Keep it loud.

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,470
Shimito guash. No.

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,620
Repeat please. Mark, I'm sorry, because people are asking me questions

24
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,300
on pref, on chat about the organization's things.

25
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,496
I have to do everything at once. Repeat,

26
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,950
please. They don't pay you enough.

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,804
And so I'm just asking for the volume to stay

28
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:56,452
the same as he descends, for his focus to be on that

29
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,072
that it stays loud.

30
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,568
Yaksarashi Machid.

31
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:04,460
Nolitonadora.

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,430
Who.

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,530
Did I lose them?

34
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,890
Wow. I'm afraid we did.

35
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,610
Okay,

36
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,264
maybe let's just no, we have Alex Axel, our user.

37
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:33,188
Yeah, we'll just okay,

38
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:34,150
we're back.

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,650
So now the other way.

40
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,760
This way. Constrona.

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,164
But you

42
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,300
want the noise.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:20,500
Olaras slower.

44
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,812
Pavoli grasna will translate and I will us answer

45
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,270
the questions on each other.

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,144
The goal here is Axel's

47
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:52,492
brain is avoiding what is uncomfortable

48
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,932
both physically and emotionally. So there is the gap,

49
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,760
of course, the muscles,

50
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,116
right. Big gap between them. And so what I'm

51
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:06,564
asking him to do by going slowly is to discover all

52
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:10,592
of this uncoordinated stuff in the middle. We are trained

53
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:13,728
to avoid that because of embarrassment.

54
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:17,012
And so sitting right there, where the awkward

55
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:28,276
spot is Oakness

56
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,356
of the vocal folds, by delaying that,

57
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,808
trying to desensitize the avoidance,

58
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:38,300
it is unconscious. He's not thinking to avoid it,

59
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,224
he wants to sing there. But it is unconsciously being

60
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:46,290
avoided because brains hate embarrassment. And so

61
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,820
those are the two working zones that's Poland

62
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,668
and Lithuania. And so we got nothing in the shared space

63
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:59,668
here. And so I want him to go very slowly through that area,

64
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,172
and I would ideally ask somebody to go right there

65
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:04,100
immediately.

66
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,250
Axel, can you make that sound?

67
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,250
Axel. Taki sam jivings. Probably.

68
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,090
Ah.

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,520
Hello. Axel. Putrabiya.

70
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,160
Hello. Hello. Is the stamrugim

71
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,570
okay?

72
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,930
It good.

73
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,530
A little higher.

74
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,736
Ah. Too clear.

75
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:18,240
We want noisy.

76
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,010
WA.

77
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,488
Still too good. We want worse.

78
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:34,390
Wow.

79
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,440
Zawadmi. We want ugly.

80
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,570
Wow.

81
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,050
Almost. Wow.

82
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,570
Ah. As like a witch. Yeah,

83
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,810
my little pretty.

84
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,790
Yeah. Lower volume. Yeah.

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,580
OOH. OOH.

86
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,500
OOH.

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,656
OOH. So the

88
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,080
volume disappeared.

89
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,850
We need the volume to be the same.

90
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,120
OOH.

91
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,032
It's la.

92
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,730
La. La.

93
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,010
Good. La.

94
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,890
La.

95
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,310
Volume. La.

96
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,150
Same volume. La.

97
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,010
But we want the noise. La.

98
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,010
We want noisy. Ah.

99
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,820
Too clean. Too good. We want noisy.

100
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,810
La.

101
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,490
So la.

102
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,250
Start in the noise. La.

103
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,730
La. La.

104
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,610
Yes, yes. La.

105
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,250
Eight notes. This many notes. La.

106
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,090
La. So la.

107
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,720
La. One note.

108
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,730
La. No,

109
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,970
keep going. Even if it sounds bad. Keep going,

110
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,570
La.

111
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,960
More notes with noise will give you

112
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,650
halfway to La.

113
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,850
Connecting La.

114
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,810
We want noise in between.

115
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,530
La. La.

116
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,104
La. That's okay. Now from

117
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:17,824
there,

118
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:30,460
laxel axel.

119
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,330
La.

120
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,388
La. Good. So now pitch

121
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:44,090
has dropped La.

122
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,930
So we need this la.

123
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,770
It's going to be an ugly ending. That's okay.

124
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,264
La make

125
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,130
this sound.

126
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,890
Ah.

127
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,060
That's not the pitch.

128
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,350
Plus noise. So now

129
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,144
great.

130
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,880
OOH.

131
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,680
OOH.

132
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,160
OOH.

133
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,570
Sing.

134
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,376
Yes. See?

135
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:17,680
OOH.

136
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:42,600
O. Yes. See OOH.

137
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,050
WA. Okay,

138
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,370
we gotta finish.

139
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,010
O.

140
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,850
Yes.

141
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,570
Slower. O.
