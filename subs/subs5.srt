1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,240
Used muscle tension to resolve lots of problems,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,526
immediate problems of just hitting a note, getting the volume I needed or

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:12,346
the sound I needed. And in doing so, I really created

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,598
a very external way of singing that cost me,

5
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:19,038
obviously, my longevity. And so

6
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,446
I would start losing my voice by the end of the night. Then I

7
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:26,050
had another problem. So all of this gets very complex.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,474
So I had to break it down to survival.

9
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,942
And as I started to study the voice, it became apparent that

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,394
what they were talking about in theory of isolating

11
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:41,562
a pitch, I could never practice that in reality because

12
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:45,078
when I'm singing a chorus of a song, it also has a timbre

13
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:49,098
and it also has a volume. So it was never applying. So I

14
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:53,738
at first took melodies from songs and made them into exercises

15
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:57,886
with the first students I was working with. And I

16
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:01,386
wasn't good enough at it because they kept recognizing the songs

17
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:04,318
I was using. So they just wanted to sing that song. And I was like,

18
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:08,606
all right, this is not working. So what I found to be useful about exercises

19
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:11,300
is that no one has sung it before.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,426
So I will create a melody that person in

21
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:18,870
front of me hasn't sung. Therefore they have no reference.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,722
And so if it is an unfamiliar melody,

23
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:26,614
now we can start with a blank canvas and now start

24
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:30,346
to talk about the attributes. What is the volume? Did you just

25
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,686
get louder or softer along with changing pitch?

26
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:37,754
And the more I ask those questions, the more they are developing a

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,886
very good perception, a very larger perception of the whole

28
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:44,960
of the voice, not just one aspect or another.

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,694
And so I have a lot of exercises that I use

30
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,294
simply because I think of a variety. Just like

31
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:57,250
when you go to the gym, I think they call it muscle confusion

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,478
when you constantly change the exercise.

33
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:04,414
And the reason for that is that brains are very good at finding

34
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:07,814
shortcuts. So if you use the same exercise or

35
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:11,414
the same melody, the brain will find a shortcut of

36
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:15,446
where the end result you want is. And that loses value

37
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,626
as an exercise. So I will change something

38
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:22,186
about the melody or the volume or the timbre just

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,514
to keep the brain processing so that they can

40
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:29,686
develop beggars skills and not just have single programs

41
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,340
that they follow.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,854
There's a question. Can I ask a question? So when you

43
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,406
teach somebody and you're talking about pitch, you have

44
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:47,490
four things. Do you give a mention to the others? In other words,

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,722
do this pitch. I want you to stay at the same volume. Is there always

46
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:54,802
a nod to each one of those individual focuses so that people

47
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:58,194
are conscious of each one and they've got a direction

48
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:01,510
on each one at the same time? Yes, absolutely.

49
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,602
Because when somebody will come to me, especially a hyper functioning

50
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,050
singer will say, listen to my voice.

51
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,700
That pitch, that pitch right there doesn't work.

52
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,938
I'm encountering this a lot where somebody will sing up a scale and

53
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,838
they'll have a particular pitch and I'll say,

54
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:26,106
okay, sounds like a broken string on a guitar or a piano

55
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:30,030
that doesn't work. And obviously we know that's not true,

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,250
but they're imagining this as a scale.

57
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,466
Hear that? And so I will say,

58
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,066
okay, let's take that and do this

59
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,282
now. So with a different

60
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:48,120
timbre, all of a sudden they will get a success.

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,130
Or if they lower the volume or raise the volume, the same pitch

62
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,574
that they said didn't work does work. So they begin

63
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:59,142
to see that it's a circumstance, not a pitch.

64
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:02,380
And the circumstance involves all four things.

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,322
Obviously time somebody

66
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:10,574
will be able to sustain for a little bit and then the voice goes

67
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:16,606
in the trash. That's one issue. Or they

68
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,914
will start in a trash and then come out of it using more force,

69
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:24,418
of course. So all of these circumstances are always,

70
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:28,722
those four things are always affecting each other. So for

71
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:32,466
therapy's sake, the obvious funny answer is, okay,

72
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:36,174
if that note doesn't work, don't sing it. Sing it louder,

73
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,366
sing it softer, sing it with a different timbre. And I

74
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:43,334
know everybody here does that as well, of just asking that sound

75
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:47,410
to share a different space. So we'll go a little darker,

76
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,306
a little brighter, a little deeper, a little bit louder, a little

77
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:55,226
bit softer. It's a joystick and it's a four

78
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,546
dimension sphere. That's why I like the ball as

79
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:03,166
an analogy. Because there is no top or bottom, there is

80
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:06,874
no left or right. It is a sphere. And so therefore,

81
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:09,966
we could start at any point on a sphere and

82
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,830
include the whole rest of its volume.

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,834
And so to answer your question, yes, I always mention

84
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:20,306
the volume that we're at and the timbre that

85
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:23,522
we're using and the duration that we're holding it.

86
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,542
And I find duration to be the sticking point as people

87
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:31,000
will continually hold a note until they like the sound.

88
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,774
That's a cheat. That can't happen in a song. And so

89
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:40,450
I find those singers that tend to hold a note until they like it,

90
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,006
they get overwhelmed when singing a song because the tempo

91
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,674
is clicking by and they want some notes back that they didn't like how

92
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:51,258
they came out. But now the tempo of the song keeps

93
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:54,478
them moving. And so I will have somebody

94
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,920
sing something again.

95
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,526
Voice cracks or something, I'll say, okay, don't stall on that

96
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:06,046
note. I don't want

97
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:09,474
them to do that because that's going to form a belief in their mind that

98
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,846
they can always fix something on the fly. When it's

99
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:16,066
more like throwing a ball, you don't get the ball back once

100
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:19,446
it leaves your hand. So if it misses its target, you could

101
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:22,786
throw again. But you can't change the trajectory

102
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:26,566
of the ball once it's released. And that's exactly what we're doing.

103
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:30,326
When we're releasing sound waves, they already have a trajectory

104
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:33,962
and a response. The listener has already heard it. And so getting

105
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:38,678
in real time, getting present, is all a part of this development

106
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,222
of being a better instrument, one that responds in

107
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,206
real time, in four dimensions. As you have a thought,

108
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:50,046
it's occurring here. It's very scary to people in

109
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,682
the beginning that their thoughts are going to translate into

110
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:57,086
sounds immediately, but that's singing,

111
00:06:57,198 --> 00:07:00,766
and that's why we feel vulnerable. But that's why it's

112
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:04,402
so powerful. When done well, it is the sound

113
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:08,166
of the truth. And as we reveal ourselves in

114
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:12,834
a song, if we have that flow, that's empathy

115
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:16,454
that everybody on the planet can feel, can understand, they can

116
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:20,978
hear inhibition, they can hear hesitation. And so when that's missing,

117
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,518
the sound of our voice is the sound of a truth.

118
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,042
Even if we're not feeling what we're singing about at that moment,

119
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:31,630
that's what the skill is all about, to recreate the human

120
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,182
experience on command. So building

121
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:38,282
this instrument for developing singers,

122
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,962
which is the term I like to use instead of beginner, is that they're developing

123
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:45,666
an instrument. I like to make sure we stay on all

124
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:49,742
four of those parameters all the time. So if they're

125
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:54,014
new to it and have never explored their voice very simple exercises,

126
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:58,082
very playful. And the more advanced somebody is in their development,

127
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:01,782
the more we talk about the nuance and the real small detail,

128
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,174
a subtle change in volume, a subtle change in

129
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:08,470
timbre, and it just depends on what challenge

130
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,140
a person is up for.

131
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,930
Great. I cannot see any more exercises

132
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,234
as there is already 1

133
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:28,480
hour talk. Actually, we have one. Marcia Book

134
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,346
would like to also now

135
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,490
you need to unmute Marcia.

136
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,980
Sorry. I actually think I actually already asked the question,

137
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,702
so you can just drop your hand or maybe I will lower

138
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:50,520
your okay, great.

139
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,374
So we have two more hours and six singers.

140
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:01,334
So do we have Alex ready? I cannot

141
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:04,554
see him. Alex, can you raise your hand?

142
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,660
Yeah, I can see him now.

143
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,920
Alex? Hello.

144
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,560
Can you turn your video on?

145
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,560
Yes.

146
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,700
I'll just add you to the spotlight with Mark.

147
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,220
Where are you? I couldn't see. I'm here.

148
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,680
Say something again. Now I can see. Okay. Hello.

149
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,854
Got it? Yeah. And where is

150
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:43,670
Alex?

151
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,940
My problem is voice is

152
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,370
no blading registers.

153
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,670
And so does your mother or father have a very deep voice?

154
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,270
My father. And do you sound like your father?

155
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,600
No. Does he have a lower voice than you?

156
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,360
I don't know. Oh, you know.

157
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,430
Have you seen your father?

158
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,206
No. Oh, okay. And so

159
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:31,314
who in the household where you live has a deep voice?

160
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,840
Somebody else? Yeah.

161
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,946
And so if I ask you to make that sound,

162
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:41,020
what happens?

163
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,670
So here's the deal, Alex. When you're at A,

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,620
what's your favorite sport?

165
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,310
Running. Running, you said?

166
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah. If you're watching a good friend win

167
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,816
a race and you're in the stands watching,

168
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:14,056
are you going to go, yeah, that's good, I'm glad, or are

169
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,150
you going to go, whoa, yeah.

170
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,630
Which reaction would be more normal once?

171
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,676
So can you your best friend just won

172
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,024
a race and you go, whoa, can I hear that

173
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:35,936
sound? You make that sound or your version of it doesn't have to be what

174
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,690
I did.

175
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,484
One person. Okay, so Alex,

176
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,876
we can see this very clearly

177
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:57,304
that this is not a vocal issue, this is an

178
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,064
Alex issue. And so I

179
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,804
was you when I was 16, that's how old you are, right?

180
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:07,356
16, yeah. When I was 16, I was exactly

181
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,768
like you in that I did not want to do anything stupid

182
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:15,484
or anything that would cause me to be embarrassed.

183
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,924
And so I spoke down here, and I spoke

184
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,524
down here a lot, and I was just going through puberty,

185
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:26,192
obviously, and so therefore there was a lot of confusion.

186
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,796
My skin was terrible, I was very skinny, and I

187
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:33,024
was afraid of the universe.

188
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,484
And so the idea of making

189
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:39,990
big joyous sounds was like out of the question.

190
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,212
Let's interrupt you two questions. Alex or Axel?

191
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:47,956
Because I had to axel, sorry. So you're Axel,

192
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:51,130
not Alex. Somebody wrote me down

193
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,932
the bad version. Okay, the second question, axel,

194
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:57,800
do you need any translation?

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,470
Had a better understanding. Thank you.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,780
Mark movie barzoniski.

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,024
I just translated that when you've been

198
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:39,772
growing up, you also tries to

199
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:44,190
speak with your low voice. And so it is

200
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,310
so five years ago,

201
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,824
when you were eleven years old, if you had a kitty in

202
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:57,196
your hands, a kitten, you would say, kitty,

203
00:13:57,228 --> 00:14:05,920
kitty, kitty, kitty Kim.

204
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,390
So I want you to pet the kitty and go,

205
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,210
excellent, that's great. Now do the same thing.

206
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,730
Yes, to us.

207
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,204
Awesome, great. So now

208
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:39,304
I want you to go, he stuck.

209
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:49,984
He no,

210
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,880
that's okay. So do this,

211
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,610
Axel, do this.

212
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,170
But I want more noise right in that middle where it's he

213
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,480
I want e namituza.

214
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:36,704
But and

215
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,952
so Axel, do you know right where that spot is

216
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,680
where your voice breaks?

217
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,010
No. Can we do this?

218
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,670
Can.
