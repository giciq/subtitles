17
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,518
Hello. Hello, everybody. Good afternoon, Mark. Good evening,

18
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:43,858
Polish people. We are very happy to start

19
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:47,846
our first of a

20
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,350
few that we plan to do a few

21
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,494
vocal trainings for singers and singing teachers. We are very

22
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,680
happy that you are with us here.

23
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,034
It's 07:00. Maybe I will ask

24
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:07,510
Mark to make a short introduction before we start recording.

25
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,146
And let me just prepare my second computer, because I

26
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,782
just ran out from work and came

27
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:18,746
home. Our vice president, Paulina Tujinska,

28
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:22,480
is not well, as she's pregnant, and today

29
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,266
I will host the

30
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,860
workshop. Dagmara, are you hosting? Also?

31
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,970
Great. So I just have to give you

32
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,234
some I can yeah.

33
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:41,714
Okay. Dagmara is also our Mixingers

34
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:48,360
association member. Let me just give you okay,

35
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,026
now you're a co host. Great. So let

36
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:58,426
me just prepare the second laptop, and, Mark, if you can

37
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,434
say a word, I will be happy. Welcome. Check, one,

38
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:05,150
two. Good to see you. Recording in progress.

39
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,134
Got it. Glad to be with everybody.

40
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:12,606
I'd like to keep it as casual as possible, so if

41
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:16,562
there's questions, I'm open to answering any

42
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,834
and all of them along the way.

43
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:22,322
And during the course of our

44
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:26,146
working together, today is going to be focused on beginners. Tomorrow will

45
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,390
be focused more on advanced.

46
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,418
But there's no bad question, and there's

47
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:34,200
no bad time to ask it.

48
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,240
Somebody will be monitoring the chat, is that correct?

49
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,418
Yes, I will be the one today.

50
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,098
Okay, so I'll ask you then, because I don't want to be looking at

51
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,420
the chat while I'm talking.

52
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,806
I'll ask you at any time, so you can feel free to fire away at

53
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:57,946
any point, and then she'll collect them and ask at appropriate

54
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,306
times. Do you wish

55
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:05,166
to me to collect them? And if you say there will

56
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,054
be time for questions, and you don't want to be interrupted

57
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:12,654
by questions that are yeah, I think it's best I'll

58
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,410
ask, are there any questions? And then you can let me know.

59
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,910
Yeah. Okay. Let me just start the second recording.

60
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,800
The more we do, the better,

61
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,280
the safer we are.

62
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,620
Just a second.

63
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,618
I just have to come into the zoom as I

64
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:42,438
have a second zoom on myself. And this is the association zoom.

65
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:46,350
So I have to re log in. It will take a minute,

66
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,440
and I need you to allow me to share my screen.

67
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,800
Right. Dagmara, can you do it now?

68
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,420
I cannot hear you. Yes, I'm all right. Trying to do this.

69
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,750
So should I just make Mark a co host?

70
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,460
Yeah, it's possible. Or you can just allow him to share his screen.

71
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,140
I don't know what is better.

72
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,238
It okay. Got it. I'll start with I'm not sure if I

73
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:38,094
can, actually, because I'm just being a co host, not a

74
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,726
host. Okay, I will do

75
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:42,320
it.

76
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,210
I have to allow myself to record from the second laptop.

77
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,242
I can also share for

78
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:58,440
everyone. Too much to do.

79
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,840
I just didn't know that I will be the host today because okay,

80
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,162
recording done. We can start. Yeah. And so allow

81
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:13,660
you to share your screen, please.

82
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,018
Let's do it this way. Everybody can share the screen now.

83
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,220
I hope that only Mark will do it.

84
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,090
Does it work so far? Yep. I'm just going to get my slides

85
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,380
and then we'll find out. I hope so.

86
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,974
Doom beginners.

87
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,180
Let's see,

88
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,964
before we start, just a word you can see

89
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:03,140
downstairs, the participants. You can see the

90
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,544
writing, the button pokash NAPIS.

91
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:10,600
Okre, napisi. Show the subtitles

92
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,936
or don't show. So you can click show the

93
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,332
subtitles and you will see what's been

94
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:21,784
told. So there is automatic transcription

95
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:26,040
from English to English because maybe some words

96
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,352
that you will not be sure if you understand, it will be easier to

97
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:34,050
watch them written. So it works this way.

98
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,130
Dominique, will you be translating as I speak?

99
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,836
No, I just said that there

100
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:46,532
will be only the automatic transcription. So whatever you

101
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:50,304
say, there is a boat

102
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:53,976
that writes it down so they

103
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:57,972
can see the English written transcription. But we don't

104
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:01,816
translate those trainings with you because it

105
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:05,644
would take double time to get the knowledge. And many people

106
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:09,260
in Poland already speak English well enough to understand

107
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,212
what you say. Okay, well, I added my bad

108
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:17,260
version of Polish on my slide, so hopefully

109
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,730
I'm not embarrassing myself too much.

110
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,816
We are always impressed that you prepare so well for all

111
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:29,940
those lectures and you use our language,

112
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,564
which is a really surprise for us. Well, I abuse your

113
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:38,596
language. That's what I do. Anyway, thank you

114
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:40,020
for preparation.

115
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,704
The first thing that I'll start off with is just simply that

116
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:50,100
word beginner. Because if anybody is identifying

117
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,676
as a beginner, we have to think about this

118
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,470
for a second, because we're talking about voice use,

119
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,392
and there really is no adult beginner

120
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:06,304
when it comes to voice use, because we've all

121
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:10,352
been using our voice since this since day

122
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:13,856
one. And so these are the true beginners right here.

123
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,124
And when you think about all of the exploration

124
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,772
that we do when we are first born with our voice,

125
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,264
when you think about all of the experimentation that

126
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:29,004
goes on, the size and shape of the larynx,

127
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:33,012
even the vocal folds themselves are very different for an infant.

128
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:36,456
And there are little stylite cells and the

129
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,452
edges of the vocal folds, the fold itself is not multilayered

130
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:44,424
for an infant. It is a monolayered, meaning there's just

131
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:48,184
one layer and it's waiting for use in order to

132
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:51,780
trigger this incredible evolution through toddlers.
