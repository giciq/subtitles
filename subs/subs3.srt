1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,962
And so physically they will manifest.

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:07,274
They want to be physically comfortable

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:11,322
of course. But right now for beginners I think their emotions

4
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:15,082
are more important than the physical

5
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:18,314
stuff that I could get into them with muscle

6
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,786
tension and things like this I think it's a little premature.

7
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:25,574
And so I like to think of lessons same thing here

8
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:29,014
with control. I want to keep their control of

9
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:32,454
emotions to be what we're focusing on as

10
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:36,790
we work through some exercises and be playful with our voices.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,854
And so I try to explain to them that lessons

12
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:44,522
in the beginning are a playground. They're a place

13
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:47,654
to explore. It's not a place of rules,

14
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:51,498
it's not a place of failure. You can't go wrong when you're in

15
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:55,790
the playground. It's all about tapping into your imagination

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,546
and seeing things as possibilities.

17
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:03,922
And so we just play with sounds and as easy

18
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:07,346
as that sounds there's a lot to it. And so I

19
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:11,214
think that exercises like I was saying before vocalizing

20
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:16,070
are much better to be playful with songs than songs.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,262
Songs have too easy of a way to be

22
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:24,134
compared to of course the original artist but

23
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:27,510
also anyone else that we've heard sing the song.

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,622
And so it becomes an instant gap. When a beginner

25
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:35,514
sings a song they have the original in their mind and

26
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:39,660
they know they're coming short of it. And so this distance between

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,094
becomes their failure and will then hijack their

28
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:48,046
body because they know they're not meeting the standard that they

29
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:52,962
imagined. And I think that's unfair to

30
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:57,006
present that to a beginner singer that's just exploring.

31
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,766
And so I like to keep my beginner

32
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:04,386
singers singing exercises for probably longer than

33
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:08,274
they would like to because they're all interested in singing songs

34
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:12,550
and the songs they're interested in singing usually are the hardest ones

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,646
that they can possibly imagine. And so they're setting themselves up

36
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:20,482
for these little failures that I'm trying to help them avoid.

37
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:23,686
And so I will take a list of the songs they're

38
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:27,274
interested in and I will ask them what is it they like

39
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:30,394
about those songs? And I will then go and listen

40
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:33,966
to those songs to make sure that I'm hitting the same range that

41
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:38,330
they will need, that I'm creating the same physical instrument

42
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,446
that they will need. But I don't use the song to explore that

43
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:45,954
because I don't want them to have a memory of failing to

44
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:49,186
sing the song that they will take with them for

45
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:53,262
a very long time. And so the more headway,

46
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,486
the more time I can

47
00:02:56,508 --> 00:03:00,214
get to spend with somebody just singing exercises the

48
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:04,294
better instrument I can prepare for them. So when they do approach the

49
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:07,858
songs they're better equipped that

50
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:11,178
the instrument can handle the elasticity that they're going

51
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,940
to ask for, the muscle independence that they're going to ask for.

52
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,814
And so with playing with sounds there are four

53
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:24,142
variables and these variables in sound are quite

54
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:27,678
important. First, one of course, get out of

55
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:31,418
the way. Here is pitch. Everybody's very concerned

56
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:35,474
about pitch. It's the one variable in

57
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:39,986
a sound where a layperson can understand

58
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,938
that we missed the target. And so everybody

59
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,590
tends to be very focused on pitch because

60
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,190
it will expose us in the beginning.

61
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,390
And therefore pitch, I feel, gets too much of the spotlight

62
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,146
because it is always going to be influenced by other things.

63
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,634
For instance, volume. If we bring

64
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:07,622
the volume down in somebody's voice,

65
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:11,200
it may be much easier for them to sing higher.

66
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,242
But if they're using volume

67
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:18,718
in order to get pitch, those two become one

68
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:22,126
and they are no longer independent. So obviously we see

69
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:26,066
this a lot with beginners or

70
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,314
they get louder as they sing higher. So they are

71
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,246
attaching volume and pitch as one. And so therefore,

72
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,406
I know when they head into a song they

73
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:40,018
will struggle to express themselves because every high note

74
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,650
will get louder and every low note will get softer.

75
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,186
And so it becomes very predictable to the listener.

76
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,650
And immediately we can understand this person

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,474
is not emoting right now. They're singing these

78
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:58,118
pitches, but they're not presenting the sentiment,

79
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,030
they're not feeling it. And so that brings us to that third

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,422
variable, which is timbre. And this is

81
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:08,430
very important because it's a big term.

82
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,586
Timbre has many subcategories to

83
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:16,402
it. Of course, it's the quality of a voice, but it's also

84
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,650
the onset, it's also the offset,

85
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,714
how we sustain the note, whether it has

86
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:27,602
vibrato or not. The overall quality, being nasal,

87
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:31,000
oral, breathy, pressed or clear,

88
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,222
all the many attributes. And timbre is very

89
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:39,334
important to a listener. So I think it should be upped

90
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:43,260
on the list to a beginner or someone with less experience

91
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,958
simply because the timbre is what speaks to the listener.

92
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:51,550
It's what gives them a lot of information about

93
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,658
the sentiment of the song. So when I hear a song

94
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:59,502
in Polish or when I hear a song in

95
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:04,034
Japanese or in Chinese, I can still understand

96
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:08,190
the sentiment because timbres of emotions

97
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,146
are universal. Sadness sounds the same all

98
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:15,300
around the planet. Happiness sounds the same.

99
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,640
Love sounds the same. Anguish sounds the same.

100
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,814
And so we spice, we add flavor to

101
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:27,506
our singing by looking at these individual

102
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:31,206
variables of a voice the pitch

103
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:34,506
of it, the volume of it and the timbre of it.

104
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:38,138
But another element, there are four that I think is often

105
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:40,720
forgotten, is time.

106
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,242
The duration of a note cannot be separated

107
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:49,466
from the other factors. So if somebody is holding

108
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:53,634
a note, holding a pitch for

109
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:57,522
a given amount of time and as they start to run longer,

110
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:01,026
3 seconds, 4 seconds, the note begins to

111
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:01,810
vary,

112
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,600
starts to go flat because their breathing is starting to squeeze their body

113
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,806
time becomes a very important element that they maintain the

114
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:15,880
same pitch within a given amount of time.

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,166
So many times I will hear a beginner

116
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:23,286
or new singer who's looking for exercises,

117
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:30,154
sing a scale and

118
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,550
they will just simply hold this note for as long as they have air left.

119
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,242
And so they've never decided what is the length

120
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,894
of that last pitch. They simply use how much air they have

121
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:43,794
left in their lungs to determine that.

122
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:47,986
And so this is a problem because it means they're training themselves

123
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,380
to always use all their air all the time.

124
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,118
And so I've devised some exercises to stop people doing that.

125
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:59,350
But I think it's important that we view these four

126
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,906
variables as independent, yet very dependent.

127
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:08,086
They all influence each other. And the best way I

128
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:11,482
can explain that, if you could see this,

129
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:15,260
I have some put this in front of me. I have some playdoh here.

130
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,810
And so if I take this playdoh, this is pink.

131
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,174
And if I take out a ball of it now

132
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,760
if I say to a student,

133
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,506
let's call this pink play, DOH pitch and

134
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:35,300
we can play with it,

135
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,130
I can stretch it, I can break it, I can make it thicker,

136
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,030
but it's not acting alone. Now I'll take some green playdoh

137
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,062
and if I take a lump of it, let's call this

138
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:54,962
volume oops right in front. So we have volume and pitch,

139
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:57,990
but they don't act independently.

140
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,414
I'm going to mesh them together because we cannot separate

141
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:06,634
this in nature. We have of course,

142
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,366
volume, which is the amplitude of a sound wave. And then

143
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:14,110
we have pitch, which is the number of frequencies or

144
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,094
number of wiggles per second vibrations. So then I will

145
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:22,742
use a yellow playdoh and say this is timbre.

146
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:26,242
A timbre does not act alone. So again,

147
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:30,094
we have to mish it into this ball that I'm

148
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:33,426
calling a sound. So now I have

149
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:37,670
timbre and volume and pitch all in this single

150
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,360
ball, which we call a sound.

151
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,046
But we're not done. We have still time to deal with.

152
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,140
So if I take a little bit of time,

153
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,794
this would be a short note and add that

154
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,980
in. But if I take a longer bit of time,

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,570
use this blue playdoh.

156
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,142
And now I'm combining time and volume and

157
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:07,386
pitch together and I'm

158
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:14,242
rolling it up and I'm playing yee or

159
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,250
a little chop.

160
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,554
So it is this process that I

161
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:24,420
ask vocal scientists often.

162
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,254
Here is a sound it has got in within it

163
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:33,400
pitch, volume, timbre and time.

164
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,790
How can we talk about one aspect?

165
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,060
So if I try to take a little piece of this, I want just

166
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,006
the what did I say pink? Pink was pitch.

167
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:49,050
So if I'm trying to isolate just pitch,

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,342
it's a fantasy for me to say to a student,

169
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:57,034
okay, we're going to work on your pitch because I cannot

170
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:00,480
take just the pink back out of this sound

171
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,674
without also volume coming with it and timbre coming

172
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:08,146
with it and time coming with it. So we

173
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,370
are always working with all four elements.

174
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,334
It's nice to talk about just pitch, it's nice to talk about

175
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,486
just volume or timbre. Like people love to

176
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:24,694
talk about belting or mix or heavy mix and have many

177
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:28,634
terms for these timbres. But it can never be separated from the

178
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:32,794
sound in reality. And so, especially for

179
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:37,018
beginners, I like to keep them in reality and speak of the whole

180
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:40,818
sound all the time. It is multicolored

181
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,126
because it's multidimensional. There's a

182
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:48,122
lot going into this. And I want the beginner perspective

183
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:51,726
to start to expand so they see things in

184
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:55,390
these dimensions. The sound I'm making has a pitch,

185
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,154
it also has a volume, also has a quality,

186
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,754
and it has a duration. And what that does by

187
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,134
talking about it is start to expand the way they

188
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:10,934
think about it. And that's really important that

189
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:14,680
I express that they can ask for a sound,

190
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,354
anything rather than a behavior. It's when we

191
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,522
isolate those four elements and start talking about

192
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,106
just pitch or just volume, and especially talking about

193
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:30,054
the behaviors that create it, we are also giving

194
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:33,310
them, I want to say,

195
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,606
a fantasy that those elements can be

196
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:40,350
separated. And so the sound they're asking for is

197
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,066
always all for going with them all the time.

198
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:47,838
And this really gets confusing for beginners

199
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,694
because there is so much talk about registers

200
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,382
and they know those behaviors to be real because

201
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:57,080
they can suffer from them.

202
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,534
And that's all the evidence they need. That's a thing they read

203
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,590
about online called Chest Voice and

204
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,154
Head Voice and Mix and everything

205
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:12,634
else, fry and whistle. They know these things exist because

206
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:16,154
they suffer from them. And so I try to again make

207
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:20,140
this holistic approach to be very friendly for them.

208
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,080
And so I will start, hopefully you can see this.

209
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,542
This is a landscape picture on

210
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:31,934
one side. Let me draw a line here. I hope

211
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:35,314
you can see it on get my finger here.

212
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:39,074
Right here is Poland and right here is

213
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,562
Lithuania. And down here is

214
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:45,906
Belarus. Wait, let me go this way. It's hard. I have new

215
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,394
respect for weather people that do this stuff. This is really

216
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:53,158
hard. And so wait right there. Now my

217
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:56,278
fingers on Belarus. So the point here is that

218
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,754
it is always 1 hour later when you

219
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,918
walk across this line. So if I'm

220
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:06,586
in Poland and I cross over into Lithuania, I have

221
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:09,690
to change my watch. My clock has changed.

222
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,446
That's kind of crazy when you think about it. Because if

223
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:17,918
I'm right next to this line right here

224
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:21,614
and I want to have dinner, this person

225
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:25,860
on this side is not ready for dinner yet. It's not dinner time

226
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,286
over here. I've already finished over here. They've not begun.

227
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:34,100
And it could be just 1 mile away, 1 km away.

228
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,502
That's kind of crazy. And it's crazy because we know time

229
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:42,438
is a spectrum. We know it's constantly traveling. But what

230
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:46,374
humans did was divide up. And the reason they

231
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,786
divided up time was so that we could all go to work and

232
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:53,226
we could all be slaves. And so the

233
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:57,066
train would run on time, meaning they could create a schedule that

234
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:01,230
we would then have to obey. So my point is this

235
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,394
is reality. This landscape is reality

236
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:08,446
and this line is invented. So now if

237
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:11,758
I put another invention down, we recognize this as a

238
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:15,346
piano keyboard. And this note and this note for

239
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:19,060
males. This is the dreaded E and F area

240
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,026
which everybody in all the old vocal books know to be

241
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:26,550
episage a breakpoint. And that's exactly

242
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,086
where Poland and Lithuania are, right there, right down

243
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:32,470
that line. And so if I'm singing,

244
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,614
there's this huge border right there and I have to show my

245
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:42,166
passport and I've got to go through immigration and I've got to get to

246
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:45,958
this other side here. And that's a whole lot of work. So I'm going

247
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:49,140
to avoid doing that as a beginner singer. And I'm just going to go.
